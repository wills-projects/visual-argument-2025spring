My goal with this project was to convey a message that I felt like a lot of university students could relate to. Our progressive society has brought about changes to the labor market that have greatly affected our current generation, and I wanted my visual to be some sort of symbolism of the pressure college graduates face when hunting for a job. I know I'm not the most artistically inclined person, so I believed that I could better represent a message through my visual using the methods we learned in and out of class. 

I decided that I wanted to create a character in the center of my visual that would be down on their luck, somebody that appeared so downtrodden that the viewer could empathize with them. I wanted the setting to be something basic, without much interest to draw attention away, being dark around the edges with a vignette so that the focus was more towards the center. Finally, I decided I wanted to add silhouettes of people, such as businessmen, walking past them without paying much notice. Overall, the image I wanted to portray was a sense of melancholy and distress that felt almost personal to the viewer (presumably a college student). 

In terms of the baseline criteria, I think that I met everything. I definitely use arrangement of layers, images, color, and even filters/transform tools to guide viewers' attention to specific elements. In addition, I have a clear message with text in the foreground that's heavily contrasted by what's seen around it. I have credited all assets correctly, but not in the visual itself as I believe it wasn't appropriate given the thematic message. Finally, I use much more than 3 layers (13), and I used multiple tools to help me manipulate the elements on each of those layers aside from select and move. 

To display some of the work that I have done, below are screenshots of feedback that I used, as well as screenshots of my work in progress.

From the feedback above, I decided to add shadow to each individual silhouette walking as well as the main character in the foreground to add some realistic clarity to the visual. In addition, I also changed the image of the tent because multiple people stated that it was difficult to see that the original asset was a tent. I went with a more easy to discern illustration to help viewers understand the setting that the main character is currently in.

Here is an image of me using the gaussian blur as well as the 3D transform to add shadows to the image, which I wanted to do according to the light in the top left. This was done using the video that you gave us during lecture which can be found [here](https://daviesmediadesign.com/video-tutorials/create-a-realistic-shadow-for-objects-in-gimp/).

Finally, below is a screenshot of what my finished project looked like in GIMP.
