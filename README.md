# This is the repository that hosts William Lee's visual argument project.

It tells the story of a man with a college degree unable to find work. It is meant to emphasize the ruthlessness of the job market throughout the modern era, and the difficulties college graduates face when hunting for a stable career.

So far we are at the **preview** stage. As we can see there is an image of a lonely person and a background to help provide setting.

Up next is the **drafting** stage, we can see that there is a homeless man, presumeably a college graduate that is being emphasized in all white. In contrast, there are dark silhouettes of other men/women walking, completely ignoring him. In addition, the dark clouds in the background represent gloom and struggle. There is also a slight vignette to help the viewer focus on the foreground of the homeless man and bring attention to the center of the visual.
