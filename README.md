# The College Epidemic.

The future is unpredictable, and more often than not it is something we greatly worry about. The difficulty of maintaining relationships, the stress of dealing with family, and most prevalently, the struggle of finding a job. As a college undergrad, I've spent countless hours feeling concerned for my future career. With the job market being an ever changing landscape, the expectations required of college graduates has grown all the more ruthless. I wanted to delve a little into the emotional turmoil of the new kinds of stress university students undergo when facing the modern challenges of today's employment pool. I hope you enjoy.

## The Process

So far we are at the **preview** stage. As we can see there is an image of a lonely person and a background to help provide setting.

Up next is the **drafting** stage, we can see that there is a homeless man, presumeably a college graduate that is being emphasized in all white. In contrast, there are dark silhouettes of other men/women walking, completely ignoring him. In addition, the dark clouds in the background represent gloom and struggle. There is also a slight vignette to help the viewer focus on the foreground of the homeless man and bring attention to the center of the visual.

Finally, we're at the **final** stage. Each person has a shadow, with the dark figures shadows slightly emphasized. These are meant to add a little more realism to an illustration, in addition with a different picture of a tent to add clarity to the visual's setting. The main character holds up the same sign but with a different bolder font to draw more attention, and we can now confirm he is the centerpiece to the message this image is trying to convey.
