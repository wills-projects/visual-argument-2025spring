# Project 2: Visual Argument / Rhetorical Collage

Your task in this unit is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to ethically obtain images and edit them using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, inviting someone inside, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.

As you start planning your composition, consider: What ideas do *you* want help remembering? Or what do you want to persuade others of? Is there something you've noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others? See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

## Generative constraints
_to be updated in lesson 12_

### Baseline Criteria
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit **must**…

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention.
    - Use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals (e.g. design hierarchy)
* Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate in your reflection
    - If not using words, clarify your message and this choice in the reflection
* If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece
* Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text
* Use non-default commit messages that say what's changing (and maybe even why)


### Aspirational Inspirations
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit **may**…

* Organize your files through layer labeling, layer groups, repo structure
* Use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other (whether to reinforce a single shared focus or to add nuance / surprise down the hierarchy)
* Refer to assigned readings in explaining your design choices, e.g. font pairings, hierarchical levels, etc
* Be bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye
* Be subtle and crafty to make your work reveal itself only gradually
* Consider accessibility in your design, e.g. through dyslexia-friendly fonts, color palettes designed for people with colorblindness, high contrast for people with visual impairments, etc
* Include a way to find out more information about topic of argument (e.g. QR code)
* Use more than 3 distinct overlapping layers
* Use more than 3 tools beyond select, move, and text that are new to you
  - e.g. Collaborate with the machine by using automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)
  - e.g. Use layer masks / blend modes for non-destructive extraction, saturation, cross-fades, etc
  - etc.
<!-- * Alter part of a source image by compositing it with another image to change its meaning (see, e.g. the [globe as ice cream](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2021spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781038538), [pillow as pill](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2021spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781522661), [ketchup as tomatoes](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698522176), [ocean as carpet](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698534979)) -->
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately articulate your message/argument
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately describe your intended audience





## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to _your own forked copy_ of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

If you are using Box, please nevertheless share a link to your Box folder prominently in your GitHub repository.

Unless otherwise noted, materials are expected by 10pm on the following dates, so I can begin reviewing them before class the following day.

(And if you're stuck, see the <a href="#parachute-prompts">"parachute prompts"</a> below.)<ul><li> Post to the appropriate Issue Queue with your <strong>proposal</strong>, suggesting in prose the idea or appeal you're hoping to make.</li><li>In the same post, include a <strong>prospective assets chart</strong> (see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 149) naming what images you'll need to obtain and whether you'll find them or generate them yourself (or with a model).

| Tues Feb 18 | Rhetorical Collage Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, just to get the gears turning and make sure you've tested out the interface. You should have at least two layers. Turn in: <ul><li> A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.xcf)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and text so far (need not be a complete argument or collage yet).</li><li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts).</li><li>A "flat" <strong>export in the .png or .jpeg file format</strong> of your most up-to-date rhetorical collage. (For more on .png vs .jpeg, see this <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/blog/jpg-vs-png/">overview</a> or this more <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/jpeg-vs-png/">technical explanation</a>. When in doubt, default to .png, because it's lossless.)</li><li> A prose <strong>introduction to your project so far</strong>, either in your README.me file or a separate, clearly labeled plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file.

## Parachute Prompts

If you find yourself coming up to the proposal deadline and you're not sure what to propose, try one of these:

1. _Make a Cover Image for Your Audio Narrative_. You've just completed a project in which sound is everything. But how will you get people to open the track and start listening? Design a visual teaser that draws your audience in and convinces them to stick around. If you want, you can also present your audio project as just one in an imagined series, and use your visual argument to advertise that larger whole.
2. _Illuminate a Word_. Choose one word to be the centerpiece of your canvas, and show us what it denotes, what it connotes, what associations the word brings in. Use any effects, colors, textures you want, but make sure the word itself is still legible – and don't use any other words. (This assignment is based on one mentioned by Madeline Sorapure in ["Playing Lev Manovich"](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/coverweb/sorapure/); to see examples, open [the video version](https://sorapure.net/five.mp4) and jump to 7:30. See also https://www.kid-at-art.com/htdoc/members/lesson70.html.)
3. _Advertise a Course_. Think about the classes you've taken that are under-appreciated, maybe even at risk of being under-enrolled. Create *either* an 8.5x11" print flier *or* a 16:9 ratio digital poster to be distributed around the hallways, bulletin boards, and/or tables of the university, alerting people to the awesomeness that would ensue if they enroll in that course. (You've probably seen some professors' attempts at these; they're all over the English department, at least, and on the screens in the G-level elevator lobby of the Cathedral.) Include the course title and a brief description; you can skip the date and time, or make one up.

And if your parachute is malfunctioning (e.g. you need even more specific direction), just let me know. We can probably figure something out in [office hours](http://benmiller314.youcanbook.me).
